4. Build release APK (for testing before Play Store)

Run:

flutter build apk --release

This produces:
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

You can install it on a device:

flutter install

ðŸ”¹ 5. Build release AAB (for Play Store)

Google Play requires an App Bundle (.aab) instead of APK. Run:

flutter build appbundle --release

This produces:
build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

That is the file youâ€™ll upload to the Google Play Console.
