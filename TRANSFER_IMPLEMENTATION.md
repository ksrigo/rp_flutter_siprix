# Call Transfer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented both Blind and Attended call transfer functionality for the Flutter softphone app using the Siprix SDK.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Transfer UI Components
- **CallTransferDialog** (`lib/features/call/presentation/widgets/call_transfer_dialog.dart`)
  - Modal dialog with number input field
  - Contact search integration
  - Two transfer type buttons (Blind and Attended)
  - Real-time contact search with filtering
  - Clean, dark theme UI matching app design

### 2. Blind Transfer
- Direct transfer of active call to target number
- Uses `activeCall.transferBlind(targetNumber)` from Siprix SDK
- Shows progress indicator during transfer
- Success/failure feedback
- Automatic call cleanup after transfer

### 3. Attended Transfer
- **Two-stage process:**
  1. Start consult call while putting original call on hold
  2. Complete transfer by connecting both calls
- **ConsultCallScreen** (`lib/features/call/presentation/screens/consult_call_screen.dart`)
  - Dedicated UI for consult call interaction
  - Shows target contact info and call duration
  - Complete Transfer and Cancel Transfer buttons
  - Automatic navigation back to original call on cancel

### 4. SIP Service Integration
- **Transfer State Management** (`lib/core/services/sip_service/sip_service_transfer.dart`)
  - `TransferState` enum: none, initiating, consulting, completing, completed, failed
  - `ConsultCallInfo` class for managing consult call data
  - Stream controllers for real-time transfer state updates

### 5. Core Transfer Methods
```dart
// Blind Transfer
Future<void> transferBlind(String callId, String targetNumber)

// Attended Transfer
Future<String> transferAttendedStart(String callId, String targetNumber)
Future<void> transferAttendedComplete()
Future<void> transferAttendedCancel()
```

### 6. Event Handling
- Integrated transfer events with existing call handling
- Consult call state tracking in call connected/terminated events
- Proper cleanup and error handling
- CDR integration for transfer history

### 7. Error Handling & User Feedback
- Progress indicators during transfers
- Success/failure snackbar notifications
- Graceful fallback on transfer failures
- Resume original call on attended transfer cancel

## UI Flow

### Blind Transfer
1. User taps Transfer button in active call
2. Transfer dialog opens
3. User enters/selects target number
4. User taps "Blind Transfer"
5. Shows "Transferring..." progress
6. Call is transferred and ends
7. User returns to keypad

### Attended Transfer
1. User taps Transfer button in active call
2. Transfer dialog opens
3. User enters/selects target number
4. User taps "Attended Transfer"
5. Original call goes on hold
6. Consult call screen opens
7. User can talk with transfer target
8. User taps "Complete Transfer" to connect calls
9. Both calls end, user returns to keypad

## Key Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses streams for real-time updates
- Proper cleanup of resources
- Thread-safe state updates

### Integration with Existing Code
- Minimal changes to existing call handling
- Maintains compatibility with CallKit
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions

### Contact Integration
- Real-time contact search
- Displays contact photos and names
- Auto-populates number field from contacts

### Error Recovery
- Automatic resume of original call on failures
- Graceful handling of network issues
- User-friendly error messages

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. `lib/features/call/presentation/widgets/call_transfer_dialog.dart`
2. `lib/features/call/presentation/screens/consult_call_screen.dart`

### Modified Files
1. `lib/core/services/sip_service/sip_service_transfer.dart` - Complete rewrite
2. `lib/features/call/presentation/screens/in_call_screen.dart` - Added transfer functionality
3. `lib/core/services/sip_service/sip_service_call_handling.dart` - Transfer event integration
4. `lib/core/services/sip_service/sip_service_base.dart` - Added disposal methods

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Blind Transfer Testing**
   - Test with valid/invalid numbers
   - Test during different call states
   - Verify CDR entries

2. **Attended Transfer Testing**
   - Test consult call success/failure scenarios
   - Test cancel during different stages
   - Verify original call resume on cancel

3. **UI Testing**
   - Contact search functionality
   - Progress indicators
   - Error message display
   - Navigation flow

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Network failures during transfer
   - Multiple rapid transfer attempts
   - Transfer during call state changes

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive data stored in transfer state
- Proper input validation for phone numbers
- Contact permission handling

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready call transfer feature that integrates seamlessly with the existing Flutter softphone application.
