We need to update our app. Remove welcome page entirely.
Initial page: /splash → SplashScreen.
After splash:
If user is logged in → navigate to /keypad
If user is not logged in → naviagate to /login.
When the app starts, it should show a **login page** with email + password fields.

On the login page we don't need the advanced settings.

1. On submit, POST (form-encoded) to:
   POST https://api.ringplus.co.uk/v1/signin

   Body:
   {
   "email": "string",
   "password": "string"
   }

   Response:
   {
   "access_token": "string",
   "refresh_token": "string",
   "token_type": "string"
   }

2. After login:

   - Save `access_token`, `refresh_token` in local storage (e.g. `shared_preferences`).
   - Decode the JWT `access_token` payload to get `exp`. Save `token_expires_at`.

3. For every API call:

   - Before sending, check if `now < token_expires_at - 60*1000` (1 min before expiry).
     - If true → use the existing `access_token`.
     - Else → refresh the token.

4. Token refresh:

   - Call: PUT https://api.ringplus.co.uk/v1/refresh
   - Body:
     {
     "refresh_token": "string"
     }
   - Save the new `access_token` + update its `exp`.

5. For all API requests, set the header:
   Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>"

Please generate a Flutter example using:

- `http` for networking
- `shared_preferences` for storage
- Proper async/await pattern
- A simple LoginPage widget
- An ApiClient class to handle requests + token refresh

---

'POST' \
 'https://api.ringplus.co.uk/v1/signin' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
 -d 'username=user%40example.com&password=string'

Content type it has to x-www-form-urlencoded the signin

In main.dar: we have SipService.instance.initialize(). We need to initialize, only after a successfull Login /login.
If there is already hasValidToken. Then we need to call an API to get extension details.
if there is no valid token. We need login first before calling API to get extensions details.

API to GET Extension details: https://api.ringplus.co.uk/v1/extensions/mobile
It will return:

[
{
"name": "Ravi",
"extension": 1002,
"domain": "408708399.ringplus.co.uk",
"password": "1Z(OeDvN9dt0(f",
"wss": "phone.ringplus.co.uk:5622"
}
]

I have added an image in mockup folder called dialpad.png. Build exactly the same dialpad with on left top corner Name and Extension number dynamically. And right corner show online if Extension is Registered if not Offline.
Dial button need to be active and purple when at least one number is entered.

---

I have placed the output image in mockup dialpad_output.png. Keep Dial button and delete button in the position.
When numbers are entered the buttons are changing position.

- Is only happening when the restart and the credential is already in the storage. If I do logout and login, registration works fine and connection is not closed.
- Once logged in and registrerd Offline button become Online when we start to dial a number.

---

I have placed in mockup on_call_screen.png, when we dial and number and call. It should open call screen. Make sure hangup button works. Instead of putting End Call button replace it with a red round button in the same style as the dial button.

---

on CallStateEnum.FAILED, we need to come back to Keypad screen.

When testing I have no issue but with IOS, Websocket is getting closed. I can see this error in my opensips logs for Ios Invite: ERROR:proto_wss:ws_process: Made 4 read attempts but message is not complete yet - closing connection

---

## When calling a number InCallScreen shows up and timer starts. We should only starts showing timer when call is answered/established. Prior to it we should show if call is connecting/trying/ringing before starts timer once answered.

there is a small bug. Connecting and Ringing shows properly but once call is answered timer shows up but very quickly is replaced by Connecting text.
I guess when state change timer is hidden by the state.

---

I have added an image in mockup/new_keypad.jpg. Bring same look to the current keypad

---

Your changes broke the keypad page. Look the image keypad_issue.png in mockup. You don't need to create a bottom bar, on keypad, there is already one bottom bar and it's fine. fix the overflow issue. Reduce the fix height around diald number and white space. I need a proper dialpad page.

---

The issue: when the network changes (e.g. from Wi-Fi to 4G or back), the WebRTC peer connection disconnects and the call drops.

I need you to generate robust Flutter code that:

1. Detects network changes using connectivity_plus (listen for connectivity changes).
2. Listens to the RTCPeerConnection state (iceConnectionState and connectionState).
3. If a call is active and the state becomes “disconnected” or “failed”, automatically reconnection (attempts an ICE?):
   - Create a new SDP offer with `iceRestart: true`.
   - Send this offer as a SIP re-INVITE through sip_ua.
   - Apply the remote SDP answer and update the peer connection.
4. If ICE restart fails (e.g. timeout, negotiation error), gracefully end the broken peer connection and immediately try to re-establish the call using the same SIP dialog if possible.
5. Make reconnection transparent for the user:
   - Show a small “Reconnecting…” indicator while trying to recover.
   - Resume the in-call timer and UI when reconnection succeeds.
6. Structure the code cleanly:
   - Event listeners for both connectivity changes and WebRTC state changes.
   - Async/await handling for the re-INVITE and ICE restart process.

At network conditions changes Reinvite is not send instantly or Websocket connection need to be reestabilished.

Reinvite was not sent.
I feel like we are not able recreate a new websocket connection when a socket drops and reuse existing call on the new connection.

Keep last known Call-ID → SIP dialog stays valid during re-INVITE.
Use Outbound SIP with Path/GRUU → makes re-registration after transport change smoother.
Handle ICE candidate gathering timeout → fallback to TURN if STUN fails after roaming.
On iOS: background network switches are tricky — you’ll want CallKit integration for reliability.
On network change → reconnect WebSocket → if a call is active → createOffer({ iceRestart: true }) → send SIP re-INVITE with new SDP.

This is a project in initial state of developement of a multitenant PBX softphone called Ringplus built with Flutter + WebRTC.
Use case: Connects to a cloud PBX. User connect by entering manually their username/password. After registration, they can make/receive calls, transfer, redirect, manage contacts, view recents/voicemail, and configure settings. App persists credentials
Navigation: Bottom tab bar with 5 tabs — Keypad, Recents, Contacts, Voicemail, Settings. Use large top titles on iOS and standard app bars on Android.
Internationalization: English + French; support RTL layout. All labels as tokens/strings.

This application was initially started with flutter_webrtc and dart_sip_ua. But handling network condition changes seems to be very complicate.

We now need to update the code to use siprix_voip_sdk: 1.0.25 instead of flutter_webrtc and dart_sip_ua.
check for documentation here: https://docs.siprix-voip.com/rst/flutter.html, https://docs.siprix-voip.com/rst/api.html, https://pub.dev/documentation/siprix_voip_sdk/latest/, https://github.com/siprix/FlutterPluginFederated/.

You need to clean up the old code to remove all references to webrtc and sip_ua and bring the same functionality using siprix_voip_sdk.
Analyze needed codes before making any breaking changes.

These are the plugins you need to use:

Signaling & media: siprix_voip_sdk
Push notifications: firebase_messaging (Android) + flutter_voip_pushkit (iOS).
Incoming call UI: flutter_callkit_incoming.
Theme: Keep the color theme centered around purple, white, and light accent colors.
Calling Features
Dialpad with DTMF.
In-call UI: mute, hold, speaker, keypad, transfer (blind & attended), redirect.
Call history (recents) with filters.
Incoming call screen (CallKit/ConnectionService style).
Contacts & Directory
Local contacts CRUD (add/edit/delete).
Quick call from contact.
Favorites section.
Voicemail
List voicemails with playback.
Show new/unread badge.
Settings
Account unregister and reregister
Call options (default audio route, forwarding placeholder).
Notifications (push, DND).
Audio/network (codec preference, STUN/TURN info read-only).
Privacy/security (TLS/SRTP indicators, data deletion).
Appearance (light/dark, per-tenant theme).
Technical Notes
Signaling: SIP over WSS, media: WebRTC (with STUN/TURN).
Push notifications: iOS PushKit+CallKit, Android FCM+ConnectionService.
Secure credential storage (Keychain/Keystore).
Localization: English & French, RTL ready.
Accessibility: WCAG AA, large touch targets, screen reader labels.

---

When calling a number InCallScreen shows up and it's showing Connecting. We should start showing timer when call is answered/established. Prior to it we should show if call is connecting/trying/ringing before starts timer once answered.

---

When we start to type a number on the keypad, the dial button is moving to left side. Keep the dial button at the same position under 0 anytime. Same for delete button it should stay under #.

---

When Im on the call, network condition changes From wifi to 4g or vice. Changes is detected an Reinvite is properly sent and the communcation works properly. But when I hangup the call on my side (siprix), the bye is not sent. But if try to send hangup the call from Other side (after network changes), I get the Bye and the call is hungup properly.

---

On Call screen has a hardcoded value: Ethan Carter. You should display the dialed Number or Contact Name (once contact is defined).
Below the called Number or Contact Name, we should have in a circle avatar displaying contact photo if calling from COntact list and the photo is defined or when it's a dialed number an avatar with Contact Icon inside. Add some colors.

---

Make the circular avatar little bit bigger and bring it little bit down (towards the center) with dialed number. Change the gradient color from blue to purple.

---

On onCall Screen, once the call is established. I should be able to mute and and unmute a call. If the call is established. Button should be disabled.

---

On onCall Screen, we need to work on the audio output button (currently speaker button). We need to able to switch between different audio output available on the device level (earphone, speaker ou any bluetooth device available).

---

On onCall Screen, for the audio output changes look good. We need some improvements: I have place an image audio_output.png in mockup. When we press on the audio output button: We should have Earpiece (Usually Buildtin one: merge earpiece and builtin together), Speaker, All the Bluetooth devices currently connected (Bluetooth options should only appear if there is any compatible device available).
For each type of sound output, show different icons as on the image. Based on the choice the Icon of the button should change (Not always shows Speak button).

---

By default, output is selected on bluetooth, it should be earpiece. For now disable bluetooth output. Just keep Earpiece and speaker by default earpiece should be selected

---

On oncall screen, I want the background in the same style as on_call_screen_bg.png from mockup folder. Don't change anything except the background colors. It has to be purple oriented.

---

Looks good. I want the background gradient more black and purple. Change the border of Avatar circle. Avatar icon is white and the circle is also a kind of white. We cant see the icon properly.
Make the buttons (mute, audio, hold etcc) bigger. same size as the in the previous image buttons.

I want avatar circle background color same as the buttons background color.

Make the avatar circle border thinner and change to white color and add white shadow effect.

---

We need to work Incoming Call Screen. There are 2 types of Incoming Call Screen: When the phone is locked vs unlocked. We are going to work first on the unlocked one. Inspired from on our existing theme colors, build it. It should show the title: Incoming Call followed by avatar (need to show the photo when we implement the contact), if the called number is not in the contact list we should show an icon (same as oncall screen) and follwed by Caller Name and Number.
At the bottom level, we need to show 2 buttons on the left and right side: Decline and Accept.

---

When an incoming calls come in and then caller hungup it before being answered. Incoming Call screen should detect the call was cancelled and returns to the keypad screen.

---

When I have an incoming call, I have callkit starting show the incoming call when i press on the button to accept the call, incoming_call_screen shows up. When I hangup that call with our app hangup. I have IOS callkit screen, still running in the background. Hangup doenst work from both UI.

---

On the incoming call, when I try to hangup on Call Screen, the same screen reopens again with Caller number Unknown and Status: Connecting. Bye message is never sent to hangup the call.

---

Issue with Screen reopening is fixed but when hanging up the call Bye SIP message is not sent.

---

Outgoing call is not working. Invite is sent properly but on 407 Proxy Authentication Required, the new invite is not sent. Caller details is shown as Unknown on oncall screen.

---

When making an outgoing call, once the dial button is pressed oncall screen shows up and for few milliseconds Caller Number is Unknown (I guess till a replied is received), for an outgoing call we know the dialer number we should show, so we dont have Unknow for few milliseconds.

---

On incoming call and once answered siprix sends:

SDP has 127.0.0.1 and 10.31.124.203. Can siprix detect it's behind a NAT and add the public IP in the SDP

---

On incoming call, siprix send 200 OK with a=mid and a=msid and a=rtcp-mux. Can we disable them?

---

We are working on a softphone for IOS/Android using flutter and siprix SDK. You can pubspec for other dependances.
On a incoming call, I have callkit shows up. Currently it shows Ringplus Audio just below "Srigo" 1001@1XXXX.ringplus.co.uk. I need to show only the name eg: Srigo (without double quotes). If name doesnt exist show only caller number.

---

I have place callkit_notification.PNG in mockup folder look how it shows up.

We now need to show avatar on callkit incoming notification. It has to have same style as the one on OnCallScreen, We need to display contact photo if calling number is found in our COntact list (not yet implemented) and if the photo is defined. if the number is not known then show an avatar with Contact Icon inside (same as the on on call screen)

---

On incoming call, on call screen shows up when we accept the call. But sometimes when the call is connected timer starts show up but sometimes it only show Connecting...

---

Mute button not working on incoming call on the call screen:

flutter: Mute call: 205, mute: true
flutter: Mute: Active call object: null, switched ID: 0, total calls: 0
flutter: Mute: All mute attempts failed
flutter: Mute call failed: Exception: No active call found for muting (all methods failed)
flutter: InCallScreen: Mute operation failed, reverting UI state: Exception: No active call found for muting (all methods failed)

---

When we accept the call on Callkit, it should take use to OnCallScreen.

---

In the callkit incoming calls notfification shows only Caller Name or Caller Number if Caller Name is not available.

---

Sometimes Callkit shows up as a full screen on incoming, sometimes It shows as a notification. In the first I have no audio, second case I have audio

OnCallSwitched doesnt seem to start when Audio starts. Let change to show timer only when the call is answered event.

---

When the phone is locked and if we get an incoming call and answer it and hangup, callkit close up but if we open the app, oncallscreen shows up as the call is active and we need to hangup on it, to have SIP BYE sent.

---

When the app is in background (Phone not locked). When I get incoming call and accept it. It opens the app and on callscreen shows up and disappear before showing keypad screen while the call is active.

---

Problem persists, when the app is in background and accept an incoming call, the app opens and on call screen shows up for around 1secs and go back to keypad. Hanging up the call from the caller doesnt close the callkit screen in the background. Seems like the event is not sent to callkit to cut the call.

Almost everything works fine except, when the app is in background we accpet an incoming call, the app opens properlya and show the on call screen properly but there is no audio in both way. When the call is answered when the app is opened or when the phone is locked(callkit): Audio works fine.

Clean up the code to remove custom callkit code and enable incoming call using siprix builtin pushnotification and callkit as suggested in the docs and issues. I will implement on opensips pushnotifications.

Just use UDP and define a range of 5 random ports above 20000, to be picked randomly when extension register.

---

in sip_service.dart, remove account.port = port or set to 0 (for random port builtin siprix) and update account.sipProxy = proxy to concat proxy+":"+port.
Remove rest of the logic you have implemented for port issue.

We are working on Android and testing outgoing call. Call works fine. Mute button works. But Speaker button doesnt works it seems we have disabled it for IOS:
I/flutter ( 3923): Audio device selection disabled - CallKit handles all audio management

We need to make the speaker button simpler: We click on it enable the speaker when we click it again disable the Speaker (for Earpiece).

---

On keypad screen, I want the call button be always purple even if there is no number dialed but jst disabled it if there is no number dialed. I also need you to remove the gray color background on the delete dialed number button.

---

We need now to work on incoming call for Android. We need to make sure to handle incoming calls when the app is in foreground, in background or not running. I believe for last 2 cases, we need to use FCM for push notification to wakeup the app and make it register to get the incoming call.
We also need to add X-Token header on the SIP register for adding Firebase token.

Android FCM Incoming Call Integration - Complete ✅

Key Features Implemented:

1. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Integration

   - Added firebase_core: ^2.24.2 and firebase_messaging: ^14.7.9 dependencies
   - Comprehensive FCM initialization for Android devices
   - Token generation and refresh handling

2. X-Token Header in SIP REGISTER

   - FCM token automatically included in SIP REGISTER requests via X-Token header
   - Enables server-side push notification routing for incoming calls
   - Token refresh automatically updates SIP registration

3. Multi-State Incoming Call Handling

   - Foreground: Direct FCM message handling with immediate call screen navigation
   - Background: FCM background message processing with app wake-up
   - Terminated: FCM message triggers app launch and SIP re-registration

4. Notification Flow

   - Push notification wakes up app → SIP service initializes → Registers with token → Receives incoming call
   - Proper navigation to incoming call screen with caller details
   - Fallback navigation to keypad if call data incomplete

5. Code Integration Points

   - lib/core/services/notification_service.dart: Complete FCM implementation
   - lib/core/services/sip_service.dart: X-Token header integration in registration
   - lib/core/services/navigation_service.dart: Call screen navigation methods

Server Requirements:

- Configure Firebase project with Android app
- Server must send FCM push notifications for incoming calls with payload:
  {
  "type": "incoming_call",
  "call_id": "unique_call_id",
  "caller_name": "John Doe",
  "caller_number": "+1234567890"
  }

---

FCM token is not available. Do we need to register the app to Firebase project?

Token generation works fine. As I mentionned before we need to make sure to handle incoming calls when the app is in foreground, in background or not running.
Let's make sure we are handling properly first forground incoming calls: We should show incoming call screen to accept or reject a call. Implement it.

---

Dont forget here we are developing for Android, we still need to use siprix builtin callkit for IOS, I guess for Android, we can dont need callkit from Siprix for incoming calls. So make sure to handle for both platforms.

---

I have the issue on the incoming call, audio from app to caller is delayed by 6s. It's probably due to the REINVITE from Caller on 200OK. Could you adopt the code to this recommandation from siprix developers:

Reason of re-invite is few audio codecs in the 200OK library's response.
Select only PCMU+DTMF codecs on app side, it will prevent sending re-invite.

From src point of view:

\_account.aCodecs = [SiprixVoipSdk.kAudioCodecPCMU, SiprixVoipSdk.kAudioCodecDTMF];
context.read<AppAccountsModel>().updateAccount(\_account);// or .addAccount(\_account)

Check if we can only propose one codec + dtmf on 200OK (onCallAnswered event).

---

I would like to show when we lost the network or on network change, show Reconnecting instead of timer.

---

In the folder assets/incons/app, I have added all required icons for the app. Could you configure to use them for Ios and Android.

---

On the incoming call screen, Accept and Decline button are too close to each other. Add a gap, to place them on the left and right side.

On the on call screen, implement Hold/Unhold button fuctions.

---

I need to implement Push notifications for Incoming calls: when the app is in background or not running at all.
I'm using Opensips 3.4. Check these docs first:

- https://opensips.org/docs/modules/3.4.x/mid_registrar.html
- https://blog.opensips.org/2020/05/07/sip-push-notification-with-opensips-3-1-lts-rfc-8599-supportpart-i/
- https://blog.opensips.org/2020/06/03/sip-push-notification-with-opensips-3-1-lts-rfc-8599-supportpart-ii/

Code has to support IOS and Android but for now just implement it for Android. We will implement it for IOS later.

Updated SIP Registration (lib/core/services/sip_service.dart:789-809):

- Added RFC 8599 push notification parameters to Contact URI using xContactUriParams
- Android Contact URI format: sip:extension@domain;pn-provider=fcm;pn-param={FCM_TOKEN};pn-prid=com.ringplus.app;pn-timeout=0;pn-silent=1
- iOS Contact URI format: sip:extension@domain;pn-provider=apns;pn-param={PUSHKIT_TOKEN};pn-prid=com.ringplus.app;pn-timeout=0;pn-silent=1
- Maintained backward compatibility with X-Token header

✅ Enhanced Background/Terminated App Handling

Firebase Background Message Handler (lib/main.dart:101-115):

- Added top-level background message handler with @pragma('vm:entry-point')
- Properly registered with FirebaseMessaging.onBackgroundMessage()
- Handles wake-up when app is terminated or in background

Improved Wake-up Flow (lib/core/services/notification_service.dart:169-214):

- Enhanced wakeUpAndRegisterForIncomingCall() method
- Added proper service initialization sequence
- Implemented background re-registration with attemptBackgroundReregistration()

New SIP Background Re-registration (lib/core/services/sip_service.dart:1083-1110):

- Added attemptBackgroundReregistration() method
- Re-registers existing accounts when app wakes up from push notification
- Handles cases where app was terminated or backgrounded

✅ Complete Push Notification Flow

1. Registration Phase:

- SIP client registers with OpenSIPS including RFC 8599 push notification parameters
- OpenSIPS stores push notification coordinates (FCM token, provider, etc.)

2. Incoming Call Phase:

- OpenSIPS detects incoming call for registered extension
- Triggers E_UL_CONTACT_REFRESH event with push notification coordinates
- OpenSIPS script sends FCM push notification to Android device

3. App Wake-up Phase:

- FCM delivers push notification to device (even when app is terminated)
- Background message handler wakes up the app
- App re-initializes SIP service and re-registers
- SIP client becomes ready to receive the actual incoming SIP INVITE

4. Call Handling Phase:

- OpenSIPS forwards the incoming INVITE to now-registered SIP client
- App receives incoming call and displays incoming call screen
- User can accept/decline the call normally

✅ OpenSIPS 3.4 Compatibility

The implementation follows OpenSIPS 3.4 mid_registrar documentation:

- Uses RFC 8599 standard push notification parameters
- Compatible with pn_enable parameter in mid_registrar
- Supports OpenSIPS event system for push notification triggers
- Works with the recommended Contact URI parameter format

✅ Multi-Platform Ready

- Android: Fully implemented with FCM (pn-provider=fcm)
- iOS: Framework ready with PushKit (pn-provider=apns) - can be activated later
- Platform-specific token handling and registration

🔧 Required OpenSIPS Configuration

For this to work, your OpenSIPS 3.4 server needs:

# Enable push notifications in mid_registrar

modparam("mid_registrar", "pn_enable", 1)
modparam("mid_registrar", "pn_providers", "fcm,apns")

# Event handling for push notifications

event_route [E_UL_CONTACT_REFRESH] { # Extract push notification parameters from Contact URI
$var(pn_provider) = $(param(uri){param.value,pn-provider});
$var(pn_token) = $(param(uri){param.value,pn-param});
$var(pn_prid) = $(param(uri){param.value,pn-prid});

      # Send FCM push notification
      if ($var(pn_provider) == "fcm") {
          route(SEND_FCM_PUSH, $var(pn_token), $var(pn_prid));
      }

}

The implementation is now ready for testing with your OpenSIPS 3.4 server configured for RFC 8599 push notifications!

I can see the in log Push Notifications coming:
D/FLTFireMsgReceiver(23823): broadcast received for message
I/flutter (23823): Android: Received background push notification: {caller_name: Test In, callee_uri: sip:1002@example.com, caller_uri: sip:1001@example.com, type: INCOMING_CALL, timestamp: 1758196009, call_id: abc123}

It doest start SIP Registration.

On Incoming call, incoming call screen shows up. But any actions on the button accept or deny have no effect. In logs:

I believe there is an issue with login and token refresh flow. You should implement this logic:

1.  Once you login with username/password, you will get:
    {
    "access_token": "string",
    "refresh_token": "string",
    "token_type": "string"
    }
2.  Parse the response, to:
    - Save `access_token`, `refresh_token` in local storage (e.g. `shared_preferences`).
3.  Decode using JWT `access_token`, get from payload `exp` and save it in local storage as `token_expires_at`.
4.  Before every API calls, you have to make sure access_token is valid (Add this logic in API function called by every endpoint):
    - Check if `now < token_expires_at - 60*1000` (1 min before expiry). If true → use the existing `access_token`.
    - Else you need to call update access_token using refresh_token
5.  Token refresh:
    - Call without Authorization header: PUT https://api.ringplus.co.uk/v1/refresh
    - Body:
      {
      "refresh_token": <refresh_token from local storage>
      }
    - Reponse: {
      "access_token": "string",
      "refresh_token": "string",
      "token_type": "string"
      }
    - You need to repeat step 2, 3.
6.  If access_token is expired but you have still have a refresh_token in localstorage, try to refresh token as described at step 5. If Reponse code != 200 then redirect to login page.
7.  Except Post /signin and PUT /refresh, every endpoints need to add:
    Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>"

Seems like Auth service works properly. If you see any issue fix it. But there is another issue: /extensions/mobile is never called therefore app cant get extension details and get registrered

As I mentionned before, we can have incoming calls when the app in these state: in foreground, in background or not running.
When it's in foreground, the app behaviour is fine: when a call comes in Incoming call screen shows up. Now we need to handle when the app is in background: When there is a call, we have a notification showing: incoming call and we can accept it or reject it. If we accept it, it opens our app and the incoming call screen shows up and we need to accept the call again.
We need to change this behaviour to when we accept the call on the Notification, call should be asnwered and the app should open to on call screen.

Scenario 1: App in Foreground

1. Call comes in → Incoming call screen shows (existing behavior works fine)

Scenario 2: App in Background - User Accepts

1. Push notification shows with Accept/Reject buttons
2. User taps Accept → action: 'accept' sent to app
3. App wakes up → SIP service answers call → Navigate to in-call screen
4. User sees in-call screen immediately (no double-accept needed)

Scenario 3: App in Background - User Rejects

1. Push notification shows with Accept/Reject buttons
2. User taps Reject → action: 'reject' sent to app
3. App wakes up → SIP service hangs up call → Navigate to keypad
4. Call is rejected and user returns to app

Scenario 4: App Not Running - Any Action

1. Push notification wakes app → Background handler processes action
2. Services initialize → Action is processed → App opens appropriately

🧪 Server-Side Requirements:

To fully utilize this implementation, the server should send notifications with action buttons:

For regular incoming calls (existing):
{
"type": "incoming_call",
"call_id": "12345",
"caller_name": "John Doe",
"caller_number": "+1234567890"
}

For notification actions (new):
{
"type": "incoming_call",
"action": "accept", // or "reject"
"call_id": "12345",
"caller_name": "John Doe",
"caller_number": "+1234567890"
}

---

In Background mode, user reject works as expected but when accepting the call, it still opening incoming call screen and we need to accept again:

Looking at the logs, there's no call active when the user taps "accept" on the notification (call count: 0, active call: null). This means:

1. Push notification arrives → User sees notification
2. User taps "Accept" → App tries to answer call but call doesn't exist in SIP yet
3. App navigates to incoming call screen (because answer failed)
4. 4 seconds later → Timer triggers "background acceptance detected"
5. But call gets CANCELLED by server due to timeout

This is a wrong conclusion. When the notification shows up the call is already ringing state.

---

Now, accepting the call on notification open the app, on on call screen. But the call is not really accepted phone keeps ringing despite we are on the oncall screen and timer shows up:

We need to implement a Recents Call page in our Flutter softphone app.
Requirements:
Use CdrModel and CdrsModel from the Siprix SDK for call history data. Documentation: https://pub.dev/documentation/siprix_voip_sdk/latest/cdrs_model/
The UI design is provided in mockup/recents_call.jpg. Please follow this mockup closely for layout and styling.
The page must be integrated into the existing app and preserve the current Bottom Navigation bar.
Display the list of recent calls with details from CdrModel (caller/callee, time, duration, direction, status).
Ensure the UI updates dynamically when CdrsModel changes (e.g., a new call is added).
Add placeholder logic where real persistence or API integration will be needed.
